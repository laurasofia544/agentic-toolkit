**Summary:**  
AI orchestration involves creating dependable workflows by integrating various tools effectively. One common challenge in these workflows is handling rate limits, which occur when too many requests or large payloads are sent. Playwright is a useful tool for automating tasks like capturing website screenshots, particularly helpful for design feedback. Maintaining organized outputs ensures that the results from these tools can be reused efficiently.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- AI orchestration focuses on building reliable and scalable workflows with multiple tools.  
- Rate limits restrict how often and how much data you can send in requests.  
- Exceeding rate limits can cause workflow delays or failures.  
- Playwright automates browser actions, such as taking screenshots of websites.  
- Automated screenshots aid in collecting design feedback quickly and consistently.  
- Structuring outputs neatly helps in reusing results across different stages or tools.  
- Proper orchestration improves tool reliability and reduces manual errors.  
- Monitoring and managing rate limits is crucial for uninterrupted operation.  
- Combining different tools effectively leads to more powerful AI workflows.  
- Clear documentation of workflow steps supports maintenance and scaling.  
- Organizing outputs simplifies debugging and result analysis.  
- Automation supports faster iteration and better collaboration.
